Filter Design {#filter}
============

`ekf_cal` combines the architecture of a Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) with a multi-sensor calibration filter to provide intrinsic and extrinsic estimates for the following sensors:

- @subpage imu
- @subpage gps
- @subpage camera
- @subpage fiducial
